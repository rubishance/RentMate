# Operational Checklists for Landlords

## ❄️ Winter Preparedness Checklist (Review in October)
Prevent leaks and improve tenant satisfaction.

- [ ] **Boiler (Dud Shemesh):** Hire a professional to clean the solar panels (improves efficiency) and check the electrical heating element.
- [ ] **Windows:** Check rubber seals on all windows. If dry or cracked, replace them to prevent drafts and leaks.
- [ ] **Gutters & Drains:** Clear leaves and debris from roof gutters and balcony drains to prevent flooding.
- [ ] **Roof:** Inspect for cracks in the sealing (Ziefut). Re-seal if necessary while it's still dry.
- [ ] **Tree Trimming:** Cut back branches that are too close to windows or power lines (prevent storm damage).
