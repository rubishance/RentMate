## 📱 Digital Organization & Automation
*Source: Modern Digital Practices for Landlords*

### 1. Cloud Storage Structure
Don't let paper create chaos. Use a logical hierarchy:
- **Properties** → Individual folders per asset.
- **Contracts** → Current and historical agreements.
- **Financials** → Invoices, receipts, and documents ready for your accountant.
- **Maintenance** → Work orders and vendor contact sheets.

### 2. Scanning & Backup
- Use a mobile scanning app (Adobe Scan/Microsoft Lens) to convert every receipt and paper into a searchable PDF immediately.
- **The 3-2-1 Rule:** Keep 3 copies of data, on 2 different storage types, with 1 copy off-site (Cloud).

### 3. Automation Opportunities
- **Automated Reminders:** Send SMS/Email 3-5 days before rent is due.
- **Digital Payments:** Use bank transfers or apps like Bit/PayBox to create automatic digital trails.

## 🔍 Tenant Screening Logistics

### 1. Income Verification
- **Rule of Thumb:** Monthly income should be at least **3x the rent**.
- Verify with 3 months of pay stubs or bank statements.

### 2. The Verification Workflow
- **Landlord References:** Always call the *previous* landlord (the current one might lie just to get the tenant to leave).
- **Behavioral Red Flags:** Rushing the process ("I need to move in tomorrow") or offering extra cash to skip screening.

### 3. The Interview
Focus on punctuality, preparation, and attitude. If the tenant is disrespectful during the viewing, they will be difficult during the lease.

## 🛠️ Maintenance & Prevention

### 1. The Cost of Neglect
Small issues multiply. A ₪100 minor leak becomes a ₪15,000 mold remediation if ignored.

### 2. Seasonal Logic
- **October/November (Winter Prep):** Service heating, insulate exposed pipes, and trim tree branches.
- **April/May (Summer Prep):** Service AC units, check ceiling fans, and test outdoor lighting.

### 3. Professional vs. DIY
- **Tenant Responsibility:** Replacing bulbs, monthly AC filter cleaning, and minor drain clogs.
- **Landlord Responsibility:** Major systems, structural issues, and professional inspections (Electrical/HVAC).

## 📈 Managing at Scale (3+ Properties)
*Source: Portfolio Systems*

### 1. Batching Tasks
Inspect all properties in the same week and pay all utility bills on the same day to save hours of administrative "firefighting."

### 2. Standardization
Try to use the same lease start dates or standard terms across your portfolio to simplify your calendar.

### 3. Reserve Fund
Set aside **10% of gross rent** into a separate reserve account to cover vacancies and major emergency repairs.

## 📈 CPI Linkage (Madad) Guide
*Source: Understanding Index Adjustments in Israel*

### 1. What is the Madad?
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures inflation. In Israel, it is published on the **15th of every month** at 18:30 by the Central Bureau of Statistics.

### 2. The Two Methods
- **Known Index (המדד הידוע):** Uses the index that was already published on the day the rent is paid. This is the most common method in residential contracts because you always know the exact amount in advance.
- **Begin Index (המדד בגין):** Uses the index of the specific month of the payment. Since the index for "now" is only published next month, this usually requires "retroactive" calculations. This is more common in commercial leases.

### 3. The Formula
**[New Rent] = [Base Rent] × ([Current Index] / [Base Index])**

- **Base Index:** The index published on the day the contract was signed (or a specific date stated in the lease).
- **Current Index:** The index for the payment date (depending on the method above).

### 4. Negative Linkage
If the index drops below the "Base Index," the rent should technically decrease. However, most Israeli contracts include a clause stating that **"In no event shall the rent be less than the Base Rent."** Check the contract for this specific wording.
