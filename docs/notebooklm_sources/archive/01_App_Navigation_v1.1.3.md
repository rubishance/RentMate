# RentMate: App Features & Navigation (v1.1.2)

RentMate is the central hub for property landlords in Israel. The app features a high-end, minimal clean (Black & White) user interface with a glassmorphism (Glass Bionic) aesthetic.

## 1. Core Modules

### Dashboard (Global Overview)
The Dashboard is the first page users see upon logging in. 
- **Financial Overview**: Real-time stats on total monthly collection, outstanding debts, and upcoming payments.
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive charts showing rent occupancy and storage usage.
- **Activity Feed**: Live notifications about contract expirations and maintenance requests.

### Properties (Asset Management)
- **Grid/List View**: Toggle between a visual card view or a dense data list of all assets.
- **Adding a Property**: Users can click **"+ Add Property"** to enter address, rooms, and size.
- **Storage Monitoring**: Each property tracks its own local storage quota for receipts and files.

### Tenants (Customer CRM)
- **Profile Management**: Stores tenant contact details (Name, ID, Phone).
- **Communication Center**: Quick-action buttons to contact tenants via **WhatsApp** or **Email** directly from their profile.
- **Payment History**: A dedicated ledger for each tenant showing their individual balance.

### Contracts (Management Wizard)
- **Wizard-based Creation**: A multi-step form to add new contracts, including extension options and complex index linkage rules.
- **AI PDF Analysis**: Users can upload paper contracts; the AI automatically extracts key dates and financial terms.

## 2. Navigation & Interface

### Glass Shell & Sidebar
- **Responsive Navigation**: A persistent sidebar (desktop) or a floating bottom-nav (mobile) allows for instant tab switching with prefetching technology.
- **TopBar**: Quick access to notifications, language switching (**Hebrew/English**), and the Admin Panel (for authorized roles).

### Dark Mode & Accessibility
- **Sleek Dark Mode**: Full support for a high-contrast dark theme.
