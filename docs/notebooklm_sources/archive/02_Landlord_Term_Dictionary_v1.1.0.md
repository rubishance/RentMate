# Landlord's Dictionary of Key Terms

## 📜 Rental Agreements & Guarantors

### Arev (ערב - Guarantor)
A person who signs the contract alongside the tenant and commits to paying rent or damages if the tenant fails to do so.
*   **Recommendation:** Avoid accepting a guarantor without checking their payslips.

### Shtar Chov (שטר חוב - Promissory Note)
A security document signed by the tenant (and often guarantors) that states they owe a specific sum (e.g., ₪50,000) to the landlord. This note is not cashed immediately but can be taken directly to the Execution Office (Hotzaa LaPoal) if there is a breach, skipping a long court trial.

### Bank Guarantee (ערבות בנקאית - Arevut Bankait)
The "Gold Standard" of security. The tenant's bank locks a sum of money (usually 3 months' rent) and issues a guarantee paper to the landlord. The landlord can go to the bank and withdraw this money if the tenant breaches the contract, no questions asked.

### Check Bitachon (צ׳ק ביטחון - Security Check)
A regular bank check written to the landlord but left undated (or dated for the end of the lease). It is kept as "collateral".
*   **Note:** If the tenant cancels the check at their bank, you cannot cash it easily. It is weaker than a Bank Guarantee.

## 📈 Financial Terms

### Madad (מדד - CPI / Consumer Price Index)
An index published by the Central Bureau of Statistics on the 15th of every month. It measures inflation (the cost of living).
*   **Linkage to Madad:** Many long-term contracts link the rent to this index. If the Madad rises by 1%, the rent rises by 1%.
*   **Base Index:** The value of the Madad on the day the contract was signed. All future calculations are compared to this number.

### 10% Tax Track (מסלול 10%)
A simplified tax route for residential landlords. You pay a flat **10% tax** on your gross rental income.
*   **Pros:** Very simple, no accountant needed usually.
*   **Cons:** You cannot deduct expenses (repairs, mortgage interest) from the taxable amount.

### Tax Exemption Track (מסלול פטור מלא)
You pay **0% tax** if your monthly rental income is below a certain ceiling (approx ₪5,654 as of 2024, subject to change).
*   **Note:** If you earn even 1 shekel above the ceiling, the exemption reduces drasticaly.

### Tabu (טאבו)
The Israel Land Registry. The official government record of who owns the property.

### Vaad Bayit (ועד בית - House Committee)
The fee paid to the building management for shared services (cleaning stairs, elevator, garden).
*   **Responsibility:** Usually paid by the **Tenant** (for regular upkeep). Major repairs (like fixing the roof or upgrading the elevator) are paid by the **Landlord**.

### Arnona (ארנונה)
Municipal property tax.
*   **Responsibility:** Paid by the **Tenant** while they live there.
*   **Tip:** Landlords must transfer the Arnona bill to the tenant's name immediately upon signing, otherwise the debt stays on the landlord.
