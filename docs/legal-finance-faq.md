# Legal & Finance FAQ (Israel Rental Housing)

## Rental Taxes
### Do I have to pay tax on rental income?
In Israel, if your monthly rental income exceeds a certain threshold (adjusted annually, approx 5,600 NIS in 2024), you may be liable for tax.
There are three main tracks:
1. **Full Exemption:** If income is below the threshold.
2. **10% Flat Rate:** You pay 10% on the total income (no deductions allowed). Must be paid by Jan 30th of the following year.
3. **Full Reporting (Marginal Tax):** You pay tax based on your income bracket but can deduct expenses (mortgage interest, repairs, depreciation).

## Tenant Rights & Eviction
### Can I evict a tenant immediately?
No. In Israel, you cannot forcefully evict a tenant (e.g., change locks, cut electricity) even if they don't pay. You must file a lawsuit for eviction ("Tvia LeFinuy Muschar") in court. This expedited process usually takes 60-90 days.

### What are the tenant's basic rights?
- A liveable property (functioning water, electricity, sewage).
- Privacy (landlord cannot enter without notice).
- Repairs of infrastructure defects (pipes, electrical) within a reasonable time.

## Linkage & CPI (Madad)
### What is Linkage to CPI?
Linkage (Hatzmada) protects the real value of the rent against inflation. If the Consumer Price Index (Madad HaMechirum LaTzarchan) rises, the rent rises proportionally.
- **Base Index:** The CPI value on the day the contract was signed.
- **Payment Index:** The CPI value on the day of payment.
- **Calculation:** New Rent = Base Rent * (Payment Index / Base Index).

## Security Deposit
### How much security deposit can I ask for?
Common practice is 1-3 months of rent. It serves as collateral for damages or unpaid bills.
- **Bank Guarantee (Arvut Bankait):** Money held by the bank (safest for landlord, costs money for tenant).
- **Check (Cheque Bitachon):** A check held by the landlord, not cashed unless necessary.
- **Promissory Note (Shtar Chov):** A legal document stating the debt.
