# Top 5 AI Art Tips for 2024

Artificial Intelligence is changing the landscape of digital art. Here are my top tips for getting the best results from tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion.

1. **Be Specific with Prompts**: The more detail you provide, the better.
2. **Iterate**: Don't settle for the first result.
3. **Combine Tools**: Use Photoshop to refine AI outputs.
4. **Understand Lighting**: Specify "volumetric lighting" or "cinematic lighting".
5. **Keep Experimenting**: The tech changes daily!
