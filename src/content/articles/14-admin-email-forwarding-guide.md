# Admin Guide: Smart Email Forwarding to CRM

Managing multiple property owners and tenants means critical information often lives in your inbox. To keep the RentMate CRM as the Single Source of Truth, use our **Smart Forwarding** addresses.

---

## 1. The Power Addresses

| Email Address | Primary Use Case | Action Taken |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **log@rentmate.co.il** | General updates, maintenance notes, scan receipts | Logs as a **CRM Interaction** in the user's timeline. |
| **support@rentmate.co.il** | Technical issues, contract disputes, escalation | Automatically creates a **Support Ticket** with AI triage. |

---

## 2. Smart Forwarding (The "Admin Forward")

You don't need to manually copy-paste. If you receive an email from a client and want it in the CRM:

1.  **Forward** the email to `log@rentmate.co.il`.
2.  **RentMate Autopilot** detects your Admin account is the forwarder.
3.  It scans the email body for the original sender (e.g., `From: Client Name <client@example.com>`).
4.  The interaction is **automatically attributed to the Client**, not you.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** This works perfectly with standard Gmail/Outlook "Forwarded message" blocks.

---

## 3. Support Ticket Automation

When you forward or CC an email to `support@rentmate.co.il`:

*   A new **Support Ticket** is created.
*   **AI Analysis** runs instantly to determine:
    *   **Urgency Level** (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
    *   **Sentiment** (Detects frustrated or angry clients).
    *   **Proposed Response**: AI drafts a reply for you to approve in your **Admin Dashboard**.

---

## 4. Attachments & Files

Any PDFs, images (receipts, contract scans), or documents attached to your forwarded email are automatically logged. You can find them under the **Documents** tab of the respective property or user in the Property Hub.

---

## 5. Security & Privacy

*   Only emails from **registered Admin accounts** can use the Smart Forwarding feature.
*   If the original sender is not found in our database, the email is safely discarded with a log in the system audit.
